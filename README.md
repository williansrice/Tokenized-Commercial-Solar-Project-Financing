# Tokenized Commercial Solar Project Financing

A blockchain-based platform that democratizes investment in commercial solar projects through tokenization while ensuring transparent tracking of energy production and revenue distribution.

## Overview

This project implements a decentralized system for financing, monitoring, and managing commercial solar installations. It enables fractional ownership of solar assets, provides verifiable production data, and automates revenue distribution to investors based on their ownership stake.

## Key Components

### Project Verification Contract
- Validates technical specifications and location of solar installations
- Stores engineering details, permitting documentation, and site information
- Verifies project milestones and construction completion
- Ensures compliance with technical standards and regulatory requirements

### Investment Management Contract
- Tracks capital contributions and ownership percentages
- Issues tokenized shares representing fractional ownership
- Manages investor onboarding and KYC/AML compliance
- Provides a transparent ledger of all investment transactions

### Production Monitoring Contract
- Records actual energy generation data from solar installations
- Integrates with on-site monitoring systems and smart meters
- Creates immutable records of production metrics
- Enables comparison between projected and actual performance

### Revenue Distribution Contract
- Allocates income from energy sales to token holders
- Automates dividend payments based on ownership percentages
- Manages operational expenses and maintenance reserves
- Provides transparent accounting of all financial flows

## Benefits
